# Fine-Tuning LLAMA 2 with Custom Dataset Using LoRA and QLoRA Techniques

## Introduction

Fine-tuning large language models can be resource-intensive. LoRA and QLoRA offer efficient methods to adapt these models by training only a small subset of parameters or by leveraging quantization techniques. This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune the LLAMA 2 model using these techniques.

## Features

- **LoRA and QLoRA Integration**: Efficient fine-tuning by training a subset of parameters or using quantization.
- **Custom Dataset Compatibility**: Adapt LLAMA 2 to specific datasets for tailored performance.
- **Detailed Configuration**: Customize training parameters to suit your needs.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Complete process from dataset loading to model training and inference.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-enabled GPU for training
